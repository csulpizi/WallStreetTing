# WallStreetTing

Goofy discord bot that handles a server-based marketplace with fictional currency. 

Current functionality. Users can...
- transact currency
- labelled transactions
- check thier balances
- check their transaction history
- gamble with 1:1, 1:5, and 1:999 odds
- buy 'nfts' (this is intentionally silly: all this does is bake a url of a random image into a transaction to somebody)
- buy 'gifs' (very similar to nfts, but they're gifs instead)
- post 'private' photos / files, which can be seen by other users for a specified cost
